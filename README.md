# WeRateDogs

## Overview:
- This project is part of applied skills in the Data Analysis Professional Track Nanodegree offered by Udacity and ITIDA under the "Egypt fwd initiative"
- Using The Twitter archive of â€œWeRateDogs" account data which contains very basic tweet information, the goal is to wrangle "WeRateDogs" Twitter account data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations

## Output:
- I managed to deliver clean and reliable data in a Jupyter Notebook file by walking through the data wrangling process. Firstly, I gathered the additional required data to be used beside the original archive data. Then I made an assessment of several quality and tidiness issues in the data so that I can clean them later on. After cleaning and fixing all the detected issues, I prepared a report with visualizations and useful insights for the administration of the "WeRateDogs" Twitter account. The report highlighted which types of tweets can be more popular among the audience and get higher favorites and retweets.
